        <p>  Yo. I am Julian DeGroot-Lutzner, a learner, maker, and explorer, from
          West Philadelphia. I am interested in using technology for social good in the civic space. I currently attend Pitzer College
          and study Computational Sociology and I was a 2018 <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/getinvolved/internships"> Berktern</a>. For fun, I run competitively on the
          Pomona-Pitzer <a href="http://www.sagehens.com/sports/mxc/index">cross-country</a> and <a href="http://www.sagehens.com/sports/mtrack/index">track</a> teams, and I make art at the
          collaborative art center <a href="https://creativity.claremont.edu/">The Hive. </a>
        </p>
        <p>
          I took the opportunity of moving to California for college as a
          chance to explore the United States. During the
          last three summers, I have lived in Seattle, Denver, and Boston and worked at nonprofits and research centers.
          On my first free Saturday in a new city, I buy a cheap used
          bicycle and bike around all day. As I bike,
          I talk to locals, discover different neighborhoods, and gain a
          perspective for where I am living. The bike ride sets a standard
          for future exploration in my new home.
        </p>
        <p> I learn, build, and create in a similar way to how I explore a new city: actively and curiously. I am not afraid to get my hands dirty and I learn best by testing theories and ideas out in practice. I like talking to people and working on projects outside of my comfort zone. Overall, I am optimistic towards the power of technology but I am also wary of the attitude of â€œmoving fast and breaking things."
        </p>
